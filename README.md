PURPOSE:
      Perform adaptive spatial binning of Integral-Field Spectroscopic
      (IFS) data to reach a chosen constant signal-to-noise ratio per bin.
      The Voronoi method from Cappellari is here applied on big images,
      which are sliced in order to be able to run the method. The binning
      is then applied to the target image obtained with different filters.
